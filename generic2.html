								<h3>My Interests and Digital Writing</h3>
								<p>I have various interests at Virginia Tech, but they do not seem to intersect with digital writing in any ostensible way that I can see. My main interests include literature and writing, especially analytic, essay writing. I am also interested in questions concerning feminism and how gendered and racial stereotypes function in society today. I am not an active member of any clubs, though I have attended events hosted by the English Club and Students for Non-Violence. I interned as an undergraduate teaching assistant for a semester, am currently a coach at the Writing Center, and will be an intern at the Women's Center in the fall. I do not see how any of these interests coincide with digital writing, unless at some point these interests require that I create the content for a related website. However, I suppose picking up a certain literacy for digital writing would increase the relevancy of my current interests to this day and age, maybe make them more applicable, helpful, and practical.</p>
								<h3>The Work of a VT-Shaped Student</h3>
								<p>I believe that the work of a VT-shaped student consists of attaining a strong understanding of one's subject matter, as well as being literate in and familiar with both practial and liberal matters, the sciences and the arts; both what helps sustain civilization and the things that speak to our hearts, the things we live for. A VT-shaped student is involved and makes the effort to gain experience outside of the classroom and past the limits of the curriculum inside the classroom. A VT-shaped student makes the effort to ask deeper questions, to take on more daring challenges, to try new things outside of their comfort zone or the area with which they are familiar. A VT-shaped student passionately delves into the depths of their chosen subject area; supplements that knowledge with real world experiences, thus gaining wisdom; and also knows how to use the knowledge gained from studying their subject area in a way that is relevant to the technological advances, progress, and demands of today. In short, I believe the work of the VT-shaped student consists of not only retaining knowledge, but also making the effort to turn that knowledge into wisdom through experience in their field, or out in the real world.</p>
