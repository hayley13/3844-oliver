									<h1>The Essay: Components of the T-shaped Student</h1>
									<p>The vertical and horizontal components of the VT-shaped student, <br />
									and my experiences fulfilling them.</p>
								</header>
								<div class="image main"><img src="books3.jpg" alt="Open Book" /></div>
								<p>I consider myself to be a VT-shaped student in progress because of both the experiences I have had and the experiences I have yet to have.</p>
								<h3>The T-Shaped Student</h3>
								<p>The concept of the T-shaped student provides the basis for the idea upon which the concept of the VT-shaped student was built.  The T-shaped student is the particular model that various leaders in academia and the professional world have encouraged students and prospective employees to fit.  The model holds that the T-shaped student has "deep knowledge of a discipline and/or way of thinking, often seen in higher education as a student's major.  This is complemented by breadth in a variety of disciplines and ways of thinking coupled with crosscutting skills such as communication, project management, and critical thinking" ("VT-shaped Student"). </p>
								<h3>The Vertical Component of the T-Shaped Student.</h3>
								<p>The vertical component of my T-shaped student experience includes classes taken within my major - English - or that meet the basic requirements of my major.  This includes classes like Critical Reading, Critical Writing, American Literary History, British Literary History, and so forth.  This subject area is what I love, is what I prefer to study.  I love learning new things, reading new things, and writing about it all.  I would say I have met the requirements for this component of the VT-shaped student concept exceptionally well.  </p>
								<h3>The Horizontal Component of the T-Shaped Student.</h3>
								<p>The horizontal component of my T-shaped student experience includes classes taken outside of my major, and that are housed in other departments and disciplines.  Though I am not sure whether the requirements have changed entirely since then, I know that when I was a freshman, I was required to take CLEs, or classes that met the requirements for the Curriculum for Liberal Education concept, requirements that all students had to meet regardless of their major.  Luckily I was able to complete most of these by receiving early college credit in high school, though I was required to take Pre-Calculus and Calculus my freshman year of college.  Since then, the only class I have taken outside of my major includes Intro to Cinema.  I certainly could take more classes outside of my literature based major, that might coincide or supplement my work in my major.  That is why I would say that I still have some work to do in this particular component of the VT-shaped student concept.  </p>
