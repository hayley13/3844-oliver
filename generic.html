								<h3>Me</h3>
								<p>My name is Hayley Oliver, I am a rising junior at Virginia Tech, and I myself am quite new to the concept of a VT-shaped student. I am an English Literature and Language major, with a minor in Women's and Gender Studies.</p>
								<h3>Experience With Digital Writing</h3>
								<p>My experience with digital writing is not that in-depth. This class, Writing and Digital Media, is a requirement for my English degree. I was enrolled in the class once last year, but ended up dropping it, both because of the workload I had put upon myself, and because I was timid and insecure about how I would perform in the field of this particular subject matter. Because of that experience I am somewhat familiar with HTML, GitHub, and Lynda.com, but nowhere near proficient, which is what I would like to work on in this class.</p>
								<h3>The Spectrum</h3>
								<p>On the spectrum of love and hate for the VT-shaped student, I reside in the area labelled "indifferent," or "respectfully and considerably aware of it but personally could not care less about it."  I do see the relevance behind the concept, I see the good behind the idea, specifically in terms of making well-rounded students who are adaptable, experienced in the real world, and have basic levels of technological literacy, the sort of which are necessary to have in this day and age.  But I am not entirely gung-ho about the concept, not anxious to make sure that my education fits the model exactly. That is why, in this website-essay, I explain how my experience as a VT-shaped student is not perfect, not completely uninformed of the concept, but in progress.</p>
