								<h3>A Critical Sonnet</h3>
								<p>Has the poet's way been lost in this day <br />
								   and age of the scientific and the <br />
								   technologically advanced?  Nay, <br />
								   the learner models shaped like letters "T" <br />
								   and "VT" do have room to house the liberal <br />
								   arts in their descriptions, though at first glance <br />
								   they read with no mention of the liberal <br />
								   arts in any explicit words.  Perchance <br />
								   a change should be made to the models, an <br />
								   edit made here or there, perhaps in <br />
								   the minds of students too, so that they can <br />
								   use the models to their personal gain... <br />
								   Experiences give students new sight; <br />
								   the more that they know, the more they can write. </p>
								   
								<h3>A Critical Explanation</h3>
								
								<p>For my critical design, I decided to create something that not only reflected my views on the VT-shaped student model, but also perfectly represented my experience as a VT-shaped English student: a Shakespearean sonnet.  This sonnet reflects my critical intention regarding the VT-shaped student model, the same intention I expressed in my podcast and in the essay explaining my podcast.  I am critical of the model and I believe it could use some changes, especially in how it represents the importance of the liberal arts to a student's education: it could be more explicitly stated.  I am also critical of the attitude liberal arts students may or may not have regarding the VT-shaped student model, and I believe that liberal arts students should give the model a second chance and should think of how best to use it to their advantage.  Shaping one's education around the model will only give one more knowledge, experiences, and thus more wisdom, all of which enable one to do more, to create more and write more.  This is my personal perspective of the VT-shaped student model - this reflects my own attitude towards it.  I see how it can help students but I also see how it could use some work, especially for the benefit of liberal arts students.</p>
								
								<p>Because of this, I am critical of the VT-shaped student model.</p>
								
								<h3>Yes, but Where's the Digital Media?</h3>
								
								<p>The notion of digital media and online environments is implied in this sonnet, as I say "has the poet's way been lost in this day/ and age of the scientific and the/ technologically advanced?"  As I express in my podcast and as I explain in my podcast essay, the rise of a demand for those who are scientifically and technologically advanced in both the professional and academic world has left me wondering whether poets - or, to make the spectrum broader, those learned in the liberal arts - still have a place, are still necessary today.  My research proved the positive, as poets and liberal arts majors are able to recognize and create the human side to science and technology.  Not only that, but the beneficial relationship goes both ways, as gaining experience in science and technology will only enable poets and liberal arts majors to write more, create more, and do more.  This is where digital media, and this class, Writing and Digital Media, comes into play.  This class is the very example of how technology can help poets and liberal arts majors immensely.  After being in this class, I now know of two different mediums in which to get my work out there - website and podcast, which I also now know how to combine.  I know how to write in HTML and Markdown, both the shorthand languages of technology today.  I know how to create content for the web, or as Dr. Evia explained it in the beginning, I now know how to create the cheese and sauce and toppings to go with the crust of a scientifically and technologically advanced pizza.  These new things I now know how to do will only help me write and create in the future.  </p>
								
								<p>Because of this, I am also accepting of the VT-shaped student model.</p>
