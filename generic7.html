				<h3>My Podcast: A Short Summary</h3>
                           
                <p>The assignment for my podcast was to explore and place in the context of my academic major and professional and creative interests the concept of the T-shaped learner.  I did this by placing that prompt around the question of whether or not poets or poetry was considered obsolete in this day and age.  I posed this particular question because both the T-shaped learner model and the VT-shaped student model seem to lack any explicit statement regarding the importance of the liberal arts to a well-rounded education, and leave no room for students to spend time studying the liberal arts.  I chose poetry in particular because of its important role in my life as an English Literature major.  
                
                <h4>My Research</h4>  
                         
                <p>In my research of the T-shaped learner model, I found that both former dean of the College of Liberal Arts and Human Sciences Elizabeth Spiller and President Sands in their own way advocate for the inclusion of the liberal arts as a necessary component to a student's college education, as it will make that student well rounded and more in touch with the human side of business, science, and technology.  Spiller states in her essay "Liberal arts education and the VT-shaped learner" that students need to have "both inspiration and imagination," which, in my podcast, I argue are two things that students can gain through the study of poetry (Spiller).  I also cite Nikki Giovanni, poet and University Distinguished Professor at Virginia Tech, regarding the work that poets do, in terms of being innovative and imaginative.  In the episode "Soul Food, Sex, and Space with Nikki Giovanni" from the podcast <i>On Being with Krista Tippett</i>, Nikki says that poets are just trying to do the best that they can, trying to make the most out of what they have around them, and just trying to tell the truth as they perceive it.  In response to this, I say that poetry can inform a student's experience in the world, especially in how they go about fulfilling the VT-shaped student model as a part of their college experience. </p>
                
                <h4>Conclusion</h4>           
                
                <p>I further state that because poets are able to recognize and reveal what is lively and human and beautiful in matters that are scientific and technological, students should really consider incorporating poetry as a part of their VT-shaped student experience.  I also propose the idea that maybe poetry, or any aspect of the liberal arts, should be explicitly stated as a requirement of the T-shaped and VT-shaped student models.  I further conclude my podcast by discussing the ways in which, on the other hand, a poet's work can be informed and enhanced by the experiences they may gain by following the T-shaped studnent and VT-shaped student models.  The more a poet experiences and learns, they more they have to write about, and the better equipped they are in terms of getting their work out to people.  </p>
                           
                <h3>The T-Shaped Podcast and the T-Shaped Learner.</h3>   
                           
                <p>How exactly does my podcast relate to the T-shaped component of the VT-shaped learner?  My podcast reflects the T-shaped component of the VT-shaped learner in the sense that it is accepting yet critical of the model in terms of how well that model reflects just how important the liberal arts are to a student's college experience.  I come to the conclusion of two notions.  First, that the T-shaped model could be altered by having experience in the liberal arts explicitly listed as a required field in which students must gain experience.  Second, that liberal arts students - especially poets - should reconsider the T-shaped model, should be open to it, and should think of ways in which they can use the model to their advantage.  The more a poet knows and knows how to do, the more a poet has to write about.</p>        
                           
                <h4>Bardzell, Bardzell, and Stolterman</h4>    
                           
                <p>Because my podcast expresses an accepting yet critical attitude toward the T-shaped component of the VT-shaped learner, one could very well say that my podcast is a critical design of sorts.  According to Bardzell, Bardzell, and Stolterman in their work "Reading Critical Designs: Supporting Reasoned Interpretations of Critical Design", a critical design is a work that "'rejects how things are now as being the only possibility.'"  My podcast does just that by acknowledging the current definition of the T-shaped component of the VT-shaped student model and giving examples of how it could be improved.</p>
                <p>In their work, the Bardzells and Stolterman provide a "Matrix of Common Argument Types," a table that those who read critical designs can use to categorize their arguments about those designs.  The components of this table that are most relevant to my podcast about the T-shaped learner are "purpose," a quality that runs down the far left vertical row of the table, and "Changing perspectives," "Proposals for change," "Enhancing appreciation," and "Reflectiveness" (Bardzells and Stolterman).  The whole purpose of my podcast is to point aspects of the T-shaped studnet model that need some altering and explain why those changes are needed, i.e., the T-shaped student model should explicitly state experience in the liberal arts as a requirement. With my podcast, I am also trying to change the minds of liberal arts students in terms of how they perceive the T-shaped student model.  I am trying to address how the model can inform and enhance their college experience, and I am trying to enhance their appreciation for the model by suggesting that they use the model to their advantage (the more a student experiences, the more a student is able to create and do). In other words, I am also promoting a certain sense of reflectiveness regarding the T-shaped student model in the way that I suggest students be more self-aware of how they and their academic interests may or may not coincide with the T-shaped student model.</p>
                
                <p>It is in these ways that my podcast relates to the T-shaped component of the VT-shaped student model: through reasoned critique and acceptance.</p>
