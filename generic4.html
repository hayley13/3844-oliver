									<h1>The Essay: The "V" of the VT-shaped Student</h1>
									<p>Virginia Tech's enhancement of the T-shaped student concept <br />
									and my experience fulfilling it. </p>
								</header>
								<div class="image main"><img src="books4.jpg" alt="Books and Glasses" /></div>
								<p>The "V" of the VT-shaped student concept is Virginia Tech's addition to, and enhancement of, the notion of the T-shaped student.  This new component "enriches the model bringing in technological literacy, informal communal learning, and guided experiential learning.  The 'V' is achieved through a variety of intentional activities at Virginia Tech, including curriculum itself through things like undergraduate research, a robust general education curriculum that allows for opportunities like interships and education abroad, and First Year Experiences courses to set students up for success from the beginning of their time here at Virginia Tech" ("VT-shaped Student"). </p>
								<h3>How I Fit The "V"</h3>
								<p>Two courses in particular that I have taken that meet the requirements of this component of the VT-shaped student includes the First Year Experience Course that all freshmen take for their major, and Writing and Digital Media, which is also a basic requirement for the English Major.  The first course, which I have already taken, allowed me to gain an insight into my major, what classes will be like later down the road and how to conduct research with services provided by the library.  The second course, which I am currently enrolled in, will allow me to gain a certain sense of literacy with digital writing, and will help make my major relevant and applicable to the demands of today.</p>
								<h3>Further Experiences</h3>
								<p>There are futher experiences I have had that meet the requirements of this component of the VT-shaped student concept.  My experience living in a Living Learning Community - the Residential College at West Ambler Johnston - meets the requirement of "informal communal learning" ("VT-shaped Student"). My experience interning as an undergraduate teaching assistant for Rob Jacks in the First Year Experience course for English majors meets the requirement of "guided experiential learning" ("VT-shaped Student).  I would say that my experience training to be a coach at the Writing Center also meets the requirements of this aspect, for I trained under the guidance of Senior Instructor Jennifer Lawrence.  I will gain further experiences that meet the requirements of this aspect as I continue to work as a coach at the Writing Center, and as I intern at the Women's Center this fall, where I will work under the guidance of Gender-Based Violence Prevention Coordinator Katelin Mey.</p>
								<h3>However...</h3>
								<p>Despite these experiences, I would say that this component of the VT-shaped student is another that I could work on further.  This is because I would like to gain more experience in terms of internships and jobs that pertain to my major while I am still in school.  I would like to travel abroad and study in different countries to expand my horizons.  This, in addition to the other components of the VT-shaped student that I still need to work on, compose the reasons why I consider myself a VT-shaped student in progress.  </p>
