								<h3>My Future</h3>
								<p>There are other things I am considering doing that may or may not enhance my experience as a VT-shaped student. I might like to pick up a degree in Professional and Technical Writing, either as a minor or a major, which would enhance my literacy in terms of the sciences, the practical and the technological, and how I can use my English related skills to help people and meet the demands of today.  I might also pick up a degree in History, to enhance my studies in literature and Women's and Gender Studies in a liberal way.  I know that my education leans quite heavily toward the liberal arts, but I also know that I cannot lose sight of practical aspects that are necessary for my education to be well rounded and applicable to the here and now. </p>
								<h3>Recommendations</h3>
								<p>To new Hokies who have heard of the VT-shaped student concept, but have yet to experience the program themselves, I would recommend that they follow their hearts, their main interests, and not worry too much about adhering to the VT-shaped student model if it is not for them.  They should also, however, be conscientious of how it could help them in the future to be so adherent to the model.  If their heart is not dead set on one subject area, but they would like to expand the field of their interests and experiences, then the VT-shaped student concept is a model to follow, or a concept to keep in mind.</p>
								<h3>Conclusion</h3>
								<p>In conclusion, I would define myself as an indifferent VT-shaped student in progress, someone who is still meeting the requirements of the model and feels neither love nor hate for it, but a sort of indifferent okay-ness with it, which is how I would recommend other students feel about it too.  If the model is for you, then cool.  If not, then do you.  But keep in mind that it might not be a bad model to follow as a sort of guidelines on how to construct your education here at Virginia Tech.</p>
